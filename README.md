# HPV_genotyping

```diff
+ This code was developed for a project within the lab of Javier Gordon Ogembo.
```

We wanted to be more careful about providing the right emphasis for the HPV genotyping code, since are not sure those exact parameters are actually the best to use for the data in our own paper (we present 2 possible interpreations and clearly show the parameters affect the biological conclusions, without saying we are 100% confident in either).  In fact, for at least some of our samples, expect that the more likely scenario is that a more conservative strategy may need to be used.

Nevertheless, this is the subfolder with code that may be more easy for others to use:

```
Paried-End_FASTQ_Code
```

and this is the subfolder with R code to help reproduce figures for our study (but which we don't expect others to directly use for new samples):

```
Downstream_R_Code
```
