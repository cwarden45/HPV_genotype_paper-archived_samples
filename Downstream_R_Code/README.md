# Downstream R Code for Reproducibility

```diff
+ This code was developed for a project within the lab of Javier Gordon Ogembo.
```

The goal of this code is to help be transparent and provide code that can help reproduce figures.

However, this revising this code may be more difficult for others.

As much as possible, I have tried to upload the necessary input files to GitHub.  However, if that was not possible, then I noted that by saying "OUTPUT-ONLY" at the end of the file name.
