 - [Age_Analysis](https://github.com/cwarden45/HPV_genotype_paper-archived_samples/tree/master/Downstream_R_Code/Extra_Analysis/Age_Analysis) - a variety of statistical analysis to check for differences based upon patient age
 - [Ancestry_Analysis](https://github.com/cwarden45/HPV_genotype_paper-archived_samples/tree/master/Downstream_R_Code/Extra_Analysis/Ancestry_Analysis) - a variety of statistical analysis to check for differences based upon patient estimated ancestry
 - [Collection_Date_Analysis](https://github.com/cwarden45/HPV_genotype_paper-archived_samples/tree/master/Downstream_R_Code/Extra_Analysis/Collection_Date_Analysis) - a variety of statistical analysis to check for differences based upon collection date of the patient's sample
 - [Confirming-Completing_Patient_Annotations](https://github.com/cwarden45/HPV_genotype_paper-archived_samples/tree/master/Downstream_R_Code/Extra_Analysis/Confirming-Completing_Patient_Annotations) - justification for using plink Identity-By-Descent (IBD) for identifying samples that come from the same patient
 - [Cross-Contamination_Into_Samples_From_Other_Labs](https://github.com/cwarden45/HPV_genotype_paper-archived_samples/tree/master/Downstream_R_Code/Extra_Analysis/Cross-Contamination_Into_Samples_From_Other_Labs) - recovery of exact matches to the PEAR-merged L1 Amplicon in other lab's samples (where that exact sequence should be rare, or likely non-existent if there was not an index hopping)
 - [Effect_of_Human_Read_Threshold_on_Genotypes](https://github.com/cwarden45/HPV_genotype_paper-archived_samples/tree/master/Downstream_R_Code/Extra_Analysis/Effect_of_Human_Read_Threshold_on_Genotypes) - comparision of 4 sets of thresholds relative to off-target human reads to see the effect of HPV16/HPV18/HPV58 assignments (and "unclear" genotype assignments.  Repeated for the following other conditions
  - minimum 5% read fractions (overall + genotype), without qPCR filter
  - minimum 20% read fractions (overall + genotype), without qPCR filter
  - minimum 20% read fractions (overall + genotype), **with** qPCR filter
 - [Effect_of_qPCR_Flag_on_Co-Infections](https://github.com/cwarden45/HPV_genotype_paper-archived_samples/tree/master/Downstream_R_Code/Extra_Analysis/Effect_of_qPCR_Flag_on_Co-Infections)
 - [Effect_of_qPCR_Flag_on_HPV58_Genotypes](https://github.com/cwarden45/HPV_genotype_paper-archived_samples/tree/master/Downstream_R_Code/Extra_Analysis/Effect_of_qPCR_Flag_on_HPV58_Genotypes)
 - [Effect_of_qPCR_Flag_on_Tumor-Tumor_Divergence](https://github.com/cwarden45/HPV_genotype_paper-archived_samples/tree/master/Downstream_R_Code/Extra_Analysis/Effect_of_qPCR_Flag_on_Tumor-Tumor_Divergence)
 - [Human-Read_Adjusted_Divergence](https://github.com/cwarden45/HPV_genotype_paper-archived_samples/tree/master/Downstream_R_Code/Extra_Analysis/Human-Read_Adjusted_Divergence)
 - [Low_Frequency_Sample_Size_Calculation](https://github.com/cwarden45/HPV_genotype_paper-archived_samples/tree/master/Downstream_R_Code/Extra_Analysis/Low_Frequency_Sample_Size_Calculation) - simplified sample size calculation for rare genotype differences (15% versus 5% population frequency, and 10% versus 5% population frequency)
 - [Median_Off-Target_Human_Insert_Size_Distribution](https://github.com/cwarden45/HPV_genotype_paper-archived_samples/tree/master/Downstream_R_Code/Extra_Analysis/Median_Off-Target_Human_Insert_Size_Distribution) - distribution of insert size calculated from off-target human reads; matches what is expected from gel extraction, but there were still statistically significant differences between the sample types.
 - [Representative_Sequence_Analysis](https://github.com/cwarden45/HPV_genotype_paper-archived_samples/tree/master/Downstream_R_Code/Extra_Analysis/Representative_Sequence_Analysis)
 - [Sample_Type_Full_Statistical_Analysis](https://github.com/cwarden45/HPV_genotype_paper-archived_samples/tree/master/Downstream_R_Code/Extra_Analysis/Sample_Type_Full_Statistical_Analysis) - a variety of statistical analysis to check for differences based upon the archive type of the sample
