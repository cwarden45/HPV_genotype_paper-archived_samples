The more stringent read fraction filters reduce the number of co-infections, but the qPCR filtering also results in a noticable decrease in co-infections.

**B) Effect of Read Fraction Thresholds *with* qPCR Filter**

The count of samples with “2+” co-infections is the count of ICC samples with 2 or more co-infections (equal to the number of samples with any co-infections).
