Statistical significance of the effects of sample type on HPV genotype assignments in HPV+ tumor samples.
-----------------

Limma-voom uses a multivariate model to detect differences between sample types, adjusting for the percentage of human reads. Regular linear regression using linear percentages or log2(percent + 1) values was conducted for 1 variable (sample type) to provide a p-value without knowing the effect of human reads, then for 2 variables (sample type + percentage of human reads) to match the other comparisons. Log-transformed linear regression is therefore different from the binomial generalized linear model (GLM), which represents logistic regression for the status of the discrete HPV type.

Fisherâ€™s exact test (FE) and logistic regression (binomial GLM) require discrete genotype assignments. All other p-values were calculated without making genotype assignments. 

Unless the analysis directly uses the 15% read fraction genotypes, it should be assumed that genotypes and HPV+ samples were defined with 5% read fractions (to be more similar to not using a genotyping step).
